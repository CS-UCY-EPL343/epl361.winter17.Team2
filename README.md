We created a website and an administration panel to manage the website and the database.

From the website, the visitor, can report a stray animal, request for adoption, donate to organization, and read interesting articles about pets. 
The administration panel is for volunteers of the organization. From the administration panel, the users can manage the website, by adding posts/photos/videos, edit/delete existing posts. The administrator can have access to see the statistics of the webpage. Also they can manage the database, by accepting or rejecting requests, edit/add/remove/search the table of pets and the table of participants of an event.
Also, users can manage their accounts by changing their passwords or usernames. 

To have access to the website, the visitors must enter the URL http://eriakouppari97.mozello.com/home/ to a web browser. 
To have access to the administration panel, the user must have installed the software and then enter his/hers username and password for authentication.
